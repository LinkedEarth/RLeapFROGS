First, you will need to install R and RStudio on your computer. Make sure that you go through the material provided in the links before attempting the exercises. You have two solutions to attempt the exercise (1) Write directly into the console and click `run code`. You will be told whether your get the correct answer. If stuck, you can ask for a hint or show the solution. Note that the first time you do this, a cloud server will be set up and it may take some time. Also do not navigate away from the code block (e.g., by opening another exercise) as this will stop the execution. (2) Attempt this on your local machine and use the Show solution tab to verify that you did the exercise correctly. You can also use the hints to help you if you choose to run locally."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/module2"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Module 2: R for science","description":"This module will guide you through manipulation and vizualization of data in R"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/module3"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Module 3: Timeseries analysis","description":"This module provides an introduction to timeseries analysis.
