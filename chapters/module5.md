<exercise id="1" title="Introduction to GitHub">

This section from Project Pythia's tutorials will introduce GitHub, the de facto standard platform for collaboration and version control used by the open-source Python community.

In the last exercise, you will configure your GitHub account for secure logins via ssh and/or https.

[What is GitHub?](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/what-is-github.html)

[What is a GitHub Repository?](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-repos.html)

[Issues & Discussions](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-issues.html). Remember, when opening issues, always submit a minimum reproducible example. It doesn't have to use your own data, just something similar that you can simulate using a random generator or write manually. [Here](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/issues/469) is a great example of an issue with a minimum reproducible example.

<exercise id="2" title="Intermediate Github">

Now that you set up your GitHub account, it is time to start collaborating.

Learn about branches, pull requests, and version control systems.

<exercise id="3" title="GitHub for project planning">

In addition to the issue tracking and collaboration tools mentioned above, GitHub can be really useful for planning and tracking work on a project. 

[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) allow to create task boards to priotorize issues to work on or tasks to be completed. Tasks do not have to be issues; you can use cards for free-style writing (e.g., set up DOI through Zenodo). [Several layouts](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view) are available for optimum planning. 

[Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) can be set to track progress on groups of issues in a repository. You can set deadlines for your milestones, which can help you keep on track for deliverables.
