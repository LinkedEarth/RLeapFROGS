<exercise id="4" title="GitHub for project planning">

In addition to the issue tracking and collaboration tools mentioned above, GitHub can be really useful for planning and tracking work on a project. 

[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) allow to create task boards to priotorize issues to work on or tasks to be completed. Tasks do not have to be issues; you can use cards for free-style writing (e.g., set up DOI through Zenodo). [Several layouts](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view) are available for optimum planning. 

[Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) can be set to track progress on groups of issues in a repository. You can set deadlines for your milestones, which can help you keep on track for deliverables.
