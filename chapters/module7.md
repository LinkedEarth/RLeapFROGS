# 1. What are packages?

An R package is a structured collection of R functions, documentation, tests, and data organized for reuse. At its core, a package is a directory with a `DESCRIPTION` file and `R/` folder containing function definitions. It can also include vignettes, tests, and documentation.

For a gentle introduction, see [R Packages book by Hadley Wickham](https://r-pkgs.org/).

# 2. Why package?

Packaging helps you:
- Reuse code across projects
- Share work with colleagues and the broader R community
- Track development using tools like git
- Improve reproducibility and reduce errors
- Create documentation automatically

# 3. When not to package

You may not need to package your code if:
* You're writing a short, one-off script
* It's a personal analysis for a specific paper
* You're still rapidly prototyping
* You’re distributing code in another format (e.g., R Markdown or Quarto reports)
* The code is too specialized to warrant reuse

As a rule of thumb: workflows for a single paper do not need to be packaged, but helper functions supporting the workflow might.

<exercise id="2" title="Sharing your package">

# 1. Software repositories

Your code should live in a version-controlled repository like GitHub or GitLab. These platforms support collaboration, bug tracking, and continuous integration. You can learn more in [Module 5](https://linked.earth/RLeapFROGS/module5).

# 2. Software registries

Registries make your code discoverable. In R, the main registry is:
* [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) — the central repository for R packages.
Other platforms include:
* [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev) — allows automated documentation and builds for packages hosted on GitHub.
* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) — for bioinformatics-related tools.

# 1. Getting started

## User APIs

When building an R package, the user API consists of the functions and objects you export for users to interact with. A clean and intuitive API helps users accomplish their goals without needing to understand the underlying implementation.

### 1. Identify Core User Tasks

Start by listing the 3–5 key tasks your users will want to accomplish with your package. Design functions around those tasks.

Example: For a climate data package, core tasks might include:

```r
load_data()      # Load climate datasets
analyze_trends() # Run basic trend analysis
plot_results()   # Visualize the output
```

### 2. Name Functions Clearly

Use action verbs for functions: `clean_data()`, `fit_model()`, `summarize_results()`. Stick to consistent and descriptive naming conventions. Avoid short or cryptic names unless they're well known (e.g., `lm()`).

### 3. Group Related Functions

If your package includes many functions, use naming prefixes to indicate related functions.

Example:
```r
climate_load()
climate_analyze()
climate_plot()
```

Or organize functionality into submodules (files in the `R/` folder), like `load.R`, `analysis.R`, and `plot.R`.

### 4. Use S3 or S4 Classes for Complex Objects

If your package returns structured data (e.g., models or results), consider defining custom S3 or S4 classes. This enables method dispatch and makes your API feel consistent.

Example: `summary.myModel()` and `plot.myModel()` provide familiar behaviors for new object types.

### 5. Avoid Over-Engineering

Only introduce complexity (like reference classes or R6) when necessary. Simple functions that return lists or data frames are often enough.

### 6. Document Clearly

Use roxygen2 to provide thorough documentation for each function:

```r
#' Load a climate dataset
#'
#' This function loads a dataset from the specified path.
#' @param path Character string. Path to the data file.
#' @return A tibble with the loaded dataset.
#' @export
load_data <- function(path) {
  ...
}
```

### 7. Prototype the API First

Sketch how the API will be used in a script or notebook. This helps surface clunky naming or unclear argument patterns early on.

```r
library(myclimate)
data <- load_data("climate.csv")
results <- analyze_trends(data)
plot_results(results)
```

Ask a peer: "Would you enjoy using this interface?"

### 8. Keep Internals Private

Only export functions that users should access. Use `@export` selectively. Internal helpers should remain unexported and clearly documented for maintainers only.

## Package structure

Use `usethis::create_package()` to set up a clean structure. A typical R package might look like this:

```
myPackage/
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
├── R/
│   ├── utils.R
│   └── plotting.R
├── man/               # Help files generated by roxygen2
├── tests/
├── vignettes/
└── README.md
```

## Building your first package

Tools to use:
- [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org) — to streamline package development
- [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) — to write documentation inline with your functions
- [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org) — to set up packages and files easily

A detailed guide is available at [https://r-pkgs.org](https://r-pkgs.org).

# 2. Documentation

Use roxygen2 comments (`#'`) to document your functions. Run `devtools::document()` to generate help files.

To build websites from your docs:
- [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org): Creates a static website from your documentation and vignettes

# 3. Tutorials

Use R Markdown or Quarto to create tutorials demonstrating how to use your package in real workflows.

Example tools:
- [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr) — interactive tutorials in R Markdown
- [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org) — write books/tutorials
- [`Binder`](https://mybinder.org) — run notebooks interactively online

Examples:
- [dplyr tutorials](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/index.html)
- [geoChronR tutorials](https://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/articles/Introduction.html)

# 4. Testing and CI

Use `testthat` to write unit tests. Start with `usethis::use_testthat()` and write tests in `tests/testthat/`.

To automate tests on GitHub:
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow using `usethis::use_github_action("check-standard")`

# 5. Code review

Code reviews improve quality and catch issues early. Share your package via GitHub and invite collaborators to open issues and pull requests.

Consider submitting to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/software-review/) for peer review of your scientific R package.

</exercise>

<exercise id="4" title="Publishing your package">

# 1. Publishing on CRAN

See [r-pkgs.org/publishing.html](https://r-pkgs.org/publishing.html) for how to submit to CRAN. Check your package with:

```r
devtools::check()
```

The issues reported by `check()` are categorized into Errors, Warnings, and Notes. You will need to eliminate all Errors and Warnings before submitting your package to CRAN.

# 2. Automating releases

Use GitHub Actions to automate versioning, documentation, and test runs. Consider `usethis::use_release_issue()` to guide your release process.

You can also build and host Docker containers using GitHub Actions if needed.
