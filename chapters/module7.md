# 1. What are packages?

An R package is a structured collection of R functions, documentation, tests, and data organized for reuse. At its core, a package is a directory with a `DESCRIPTION` file and `R/` folder containing function definitions. It can also include vignettes, tests, and documentation.

For a gentle introduction, see [R Packages book by Hadley Wickham](https://r-pkgs.org/).

# 2. Why package?

Packaging helps you:
- Reuse code across projects
- Share work with colleagues and the broader R community
- Track development using tools like git
- Improve reproducibility and reduce errors
- Create documentation automatically

# 3. When not to package

You may not need to package your code if:
* You're writing a short, one-off script
* It's a personal analysis for a specific paper
* You're still rapidly prototyping
* You’re distributing code in another format (e.g., R Markdown or Quarto reports)
* The code is too specialized to warrant reuse

As a rule of thumb: workflows for a single paper do not need to be packaged, but helper functions supporting the workflow might.

<exercise id="2" title="Sharing your package">

# 1. Software repositories

Your code should live in a version-controlled repository like GitHub or GitLab. These platforms support collaboration, bug tracking, and continuous integration. You can learn more in [Module 5](https://linked.earth/RLeapFROGS/module5).

# 2. Software registries

Registries make your code discoverable. In R, the main registry is:
* [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) — the central repository for R packages.
Other platforms include:
* [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev) — allows automated documentation and builds for packages hosted on GitHub.
* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) — for bioinformatics-related tools.

# 1. Getting started

## User APIs

When building an R package, the user API consists of the functions and objects you export for users to interact with. A clean and intuitive API helps users accomplish their goals without needing to understand the underlying implementation.

### 1. Identify Core User Tasks

Start by listing the 3–5 key tasks your users will want to accomplish with your package. Design functions around those tasks.

Example: For a climate data package, core tasks might include:

```r
load_data()      # Load climate datasets
analyze_trends() # Run basic trend analysis
plot_results()   # Visualize the output
```

### 2. Name Functions Clearly

Use action verbs for functions: `clean_data()`, `fit_model()`, `summarize_results()`. Stick to consistent and descriptive naming conventions. Avoid short or cryptic names unless they're well known (e.g., `lm()`).

### 3. Group Related Functions

If your package includes many functions, use naming prefixes to indicate related functions.

Example:
```r
climate_load()
climate_analyze()
climate_plot()
```

Or organize functionality into submodules (files in the `R/` folder), like `load.R`, `analysis.R`, and `plot.R`.

### 4. Use S3 or S4 Classes for Complex Objects

If your package returns structured data (e.g., models or results), consider defining custom S3 or S4 classes. This enables method dispatch and makes your API feel consistent.

Example: `summary.myModel()` and `plot.myModel()` provide familiar behaviors for new object types.

### 5. Avoid Over-Engineering

Only introduce complexity (like reference classes or R6) when necessary. Simple functions that return lists or data frames are often enough.

### 6. Document Clearly

Use roxygen2 to provide thorough documentation for each function:

```r
#' Load a climate dataset
#'
#' This function loads a dataset from the specified path.
#' @param path Character string. Path to the data file.
#' @return A tibble with the loaded dataset.
#' @export
load_data <- function(path) {
  ...
}
```

### 7. Prototype the API First

Sketch how the API will be used in a script or notebook. This helps surface clunky naming or unclear argument patterns early on.

```r
library(myclimate)
data <- load_data("climate.csv")
results <- analyze_trends(data)
plot_results(results)
```

Ask a peer: "Would you enjoy using this interface?"

### 8. Keep Internals Private

Only export functions that users should access. Use `@export` selectively. Internal helpers should remain unexported and clearly documented for maintainers only.

## Package structure

Use `usethis::create_package()` to set up a clean structure. A typical R package might look like this:

```
myPackage/
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
├── R/
│   ├── utils.R
│   └── plotting.R
├── man/               # Help files generated by roxygen2
├── tests/
├── vignettes/
└── README.md
```

## Building your first package

Tools to use:
- [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org) — to streamline package development
- [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) — to write documentation inline with your functions
- [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org) — to set up packages and files easily

A detailed guide is available at [https://r-pkgs.org](https://r-pkgs.org).

# 2. Documentation

Use roxygen2 comments (`#'`) to document your functions. Run `devtools::document()` to generate help files.

To build websites from your docs:
- [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org): Creates a static website from your documentation and vignettes

# 3. Tutorials

Use R Markdown or Quarto to create tutorials demonstrating how to use your package in real workflows.

Example tools:
- [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr) — interactive tutorials in R Markdown
- [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org) — write books/tutorials
- [`Binder`](https://mybinder.org) — run notebooks interactively online

Examples:
- [dplyr tutorials](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/index.html)
- [geoChronR tutorials](https://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/articles/Introduction.html)

# 4. Testing and CI

Use `testthat` to write unit tests. Start with `usethis::use_testthat()` and write tests in `tests/testthat/`.

To automate tests on GitHub:
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow using `usethis::use_github_action("check-standard")`

# 5. Code review

Code reviews improve quality and catch issues early. Share your package via GitHub and invite collaborators to open issues and pull requests.

Consider submitting to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/software-review/) for peer review of your scientific R package.

</exercise>

<exercise id="4" title="Publishing your package">

# 1. Publishing on CRAN

See [r-pkgs.org/publishing.html](https://r-pkgs.org/publishing.html) for how to submit to CRAN. Check your package with:

```r
devtools::check()
```

The issues reported by `check()` are categorized into Errors, Warnings, and Notes. You will need to eliminate all Errors and Warnings before submitting your package to CRAN.

# 2. Automating releases

Use GitHub Actions to automate versioning, documentation, and test runs. Consider `usethis::use_release_issue()` to guide your release process.

You can also build and host Docker containers using GitHub Actions if needed.

# Hands-on exercise: Build Your First R Package

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll create a simple R package from scratch. We'll walk through each step of the basic package development workflow, from creating the structure to documenting your code and sharing it on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```r
install.packages(c("usethis", "devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "pkgdown"))
```

Also, ensure you have Git installed on your system and a GitHub account set up.

## Step 1: Create a new package

1. Set your working directory to where you want to create your package
2. Create a new package skeleton:

```r
usethis::create_package("colorStats")
```

3. This will create a directory with the basic structure of an R package and open it in a new RStudio session

## Step 2: Add a function with dependencies

1. Create a new R file in the `R/` folder named `color_summary.R`
2. Add the following function that provides summary statistics with colored output (using the `crayon` package):

```r
#' Colored Summary Statistics
#' 
#' @description
#' Provides basic summary statistics for a numeric vector with colored output
#' for better visualization in the console.
#' 
#' @param x A numeric vector.
#' @param digits Number of decimal places to round to.
#' 
#' @return A named list with summary statistics.
#' 
#' @examples
#' color_summary(rnorm(100))
#' color_summary(runif(50), digits=4)
#' 
#' @importFrom stats median sd quantile
#' @importFrom crayon green blue yellow red
#' @export
color_summary <- function(x, digits = 2) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input must be a numeric vector")
  }
  
  # Calculate statistics
  stats <- list(
    mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    min = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    q25 = quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    q75 = quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
  
  # Round values
  stats <- lapply(stats, round, digits = digits)
  
  # Print with colors
  cat(green("Summary Statistics:"), "\n")
  cat(blue("Mean:   "), stats$mean, "\n")
  cat(blue("Median: "), stats$median, "\n")
  cat(yellow("SD:     "), stats$sd, "\n")
  cat(red("Min:    "), stats$min, "\n")
  cat(red("Max:    "), stats$max, "\n")
  cat(yellow("Q25:    "), stats$q25, "\n")
  cat(yellow("Q75:    "), stats$q75, "\n")
  
  invisible(stats)
}
```

## Step 3: Add package dependencies

1. Use `usethis` to add the required dependency:

```r
usethis::use_package("crayon")
```

2. Set up Roxygen for documentation:

```r
usethis::use_roxygen_md()
```

## Step 4: Document your package

1. Run the document command to create documentation from roxygen comments:

```r
devtools::document()
```

2. Check that the following files were created:
   - `NAMESPACE` (should now include exports and imports)
   - `man/color_summary.Rd` (documentation for your function)

## Step 5: Add a simple test

1. Set up the testthat framework:

```r
usethis::use_testthat()
```

2. Create a test file for your function:

```r
usethis::use_test("color_summary")
```

3. In the new test file `tests/testthat/test-color_summary.R`, add these tests:

```r
test_that("color_summary works with numeric input", {
  set.seed(123)
  x <- rnorm(100)
  result <- color_summary(x, digits = 3)
  
  expect_type(result, "list")
  expect_equal(length(result), 7)
  expect_equal(round(mean(x), 3), result$mean)
  expect_equal(round(median(x), 3), result$median)
})

test_that("color_summary handles errors", {
  expect_error(color_summary("not numeric"))
  expect_error(color_summary(list(1, 2, 3)))
})
```

4. Run the tests:

```r
devtools::test()
```

## Step 6: Create a package README

1. Set up a basic README.md file:

```r
usethis::use_readme_md()
```

2. Edit the README.md file to include:
   - A brief description of your package
   - Installation instructions
   - A basic example

Example content:

```markdown
# colorStats

A simple R package that provides colored summary statistics in the console.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("your-username/colorStats")
```

## Example

```r
library(colorStats)
color_summary(rnorm(100))
```
```

## Step 7: Set up a GitHub repository

1. Initialize git and make your first commit:

```r
usethis::use_git()
```

2. Create a GitHub repository and push your package:

```r
usethis::use_github()
```

## Step 8: Build a pkgdown site

1. Configure pkgdown for your package:

```r
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```

2. Build the site:

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

3. Push to GitHub:

```r
system("git add .")
system("git commit -m 'Add pkgdown site'")
system("git push")
```

4. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings to make your pkgdown site visible online.

## Step 9: Install and test your package

1. Install your package from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("your-username/colorStats")
```

2. Test your new function:

```r
library(colorStats)
color_summary(mtcars$mpg)
```

## Bonus (if time permits)

Try adding:
- A second function that builds on the first
- A vignette that demonstrates your package
- Continuous integration using GitHub Actions

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've created a basic R package with:
- A documented function with dependencies
- Unit tests
- A GitHub repository
- A pkgdown documentation site

These are the foundations of good package development practices. As you build more complex packages, you'll use these same steps, just with more functions and features.
