A Jupyter Notebook allows us to:

<choice id="1">
<opt text="Deploy code, equations, and text in a single document"  correct="true">

Good job!

</opt>

<opt text="Deploy code and text. However it does not render plots.">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="Write only R and Python code.">

This is not correct either.

</opt>
</choice>

True or False? 

<choice id="2">
<opt text= "We are going to be writing scripts in R" >
 
This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="We will use an IDE as our dashboard and R as our engine" correct="true">

That's correct! We will use Jupyter's power to run R!

This is a code exercise. The content can be formatted in simple Markdown â€“ so
you can have **bold text**, `code` or [links](https://spacy.io) or lists, like
the one for the instructions below.

- These are instructions and they can have bullet points.
- The code block below will look for the files `exc_01_05`, `solution_01_05` and
  `test_01_05` in `/exercises`.

<codeblock id="01_05">

This is a hint.
