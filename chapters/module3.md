<exercise id="1" title="A Data Frame">

In this module we will be working with a marine Oxygen isotope time series derived from a global compilation, called [LR04](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004PA001071). 

Data tables, which you may be accustomed to using as Excel spredsheets, are called data frames in R.

Data frames store data in two dimensions with column names and optional row names. 'mtcars' is a data frame distributed with the basic R installation.

A popular package for manipulating data frames is dplyr.
