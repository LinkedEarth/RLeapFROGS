<div><h1>Author Checklist:<br>Publishing your data</h1></div>

---

<h2> Identify a publicly accessible repository for your data </h2>

This could be a general, non-curated repository such as Figshare or a curated, domain-specific one such Pangaea or Hydroshare. 

<h3>Why is this important? </h3>

Sharing your data in publically accessible repository enables other (and yourself) researchers to use your original data for reprocublity and replicability studies or extend your findings. 

---

<h2> Fill out the needed metadata, including the license </h2>

Most repositories will guide you through the process, including any specific mandatory fields.  

Don't forget to add a license. Here is a quick guide about commonly-used licenses: https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org 

<h3>Why is this important? </h3>

Adding the proper metadata ensures maximum reuse of your data in other studies. 

Licenses indicate the terms and conditions under which your data can be used. Make sure that you choose a license appropriate given the funding agency. 

---

<h2> Upload the data </h2>

If you are working with large datasets, make sure that the repository can accommodate them. For instance, Figshare only allows files with a maximum size of 20GB. 

---

<h2> Enable citation of the data </h2>

The citation should include a unique persistent identifier for the data. 

<h3>Why is this important? </h3>

Citations help you get recognized for all of your work. Additionaly, it is an integral part of reproducibility since it can give information about the provenance of the data.

<h2> Citing  Data in your paper </h2>

- Citation goes in the references section
- Guidelines on how to cite data are often set by the journal but includes an in-text pointer as you would cite any other paper (recommended), an in-text pointer in a Data Resources section, an in-text pointer in the "Acknowledgements" section.
