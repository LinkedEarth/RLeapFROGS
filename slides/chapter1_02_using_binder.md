# What is Binder?

Although we can install software and dependencies in our local machine, we will be working with a Binder on this module.
You will learn how to install dependencies and configure your conda environment in Module 2.

A Binder is a code repository that contains:

- Code or content that youâ€™d like people to run. This might be a Jupyter Notebook.

- Configuration files for your environment. This ensures that your code is reproducible.

---

You will be working simultaneously with the Binder notebook and these slides.

You can find the Binder [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/throughput-ec/ec-binder/HEAD).

Click on the previous link, a Binder will be created and you must see the following:

Keep in mind that any work that you do on the Binder will not be saved.
You will have to download your work each time you work with the Binder.
