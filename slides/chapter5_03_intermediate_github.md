## Make your repository citable

Zenodo is most known for data archival. When depositing data with Zenodo, a digital object identifier (DOI) is issued. Creating a persistent reference to the data exactly as they exist at the time of upload and offering an object for citation in scientific publications. Zendo also offers this service for GitHub repositories.

* Open the Zenodo [link](https://zenodo.org/login) and login <strong>with GitHub</strong>. You will need to <em>Authorize Zenodo</em> to access GitHub.
