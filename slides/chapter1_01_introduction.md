# What is R?

R is a programming language for statistical compuation and graphics. R is a high-level language like Matlab or Python, meaning that the environment is rich with data structures, functions, and variables. R is also considered a functional programming language, wherein a user serially applies functions which accept inputs and return outputs.

For this workshop, we will be using R via [RStudio]([https://jupyter.org/index.html](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/))

[RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/) are a great tool for exploration and for documenting your workflow.
Notebooks allow you to write:
- Code
- Plots
- Formatted text
- Latex text for equations

and much more in a single document!

See some examples of what's possible on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/)

- R is the programming language that runs computations.

- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding convenient features and tools.

You can think of RStudio as the dashboard of a car.

You don’t drive a car by interacting with the engine but rather by interacting with the car’s dashboard.

In the same way, rather than interacting with R directly, we will be using the RStudio's interface.

RStudio will allow us to:
- Run R code interactively
- Write R scripts, functions, and markdown
- Build and view plots
- Develop R packages
- and more

---

This is what the Rstudio interface looks like:

- The RStudio IDE makes interactive programming intuitive
- R Markdown is a get way to share your work
- Scientific programming packages for R are managed by a central repository that makes package management seamless
