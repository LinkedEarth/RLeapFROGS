# Lesson 0: Intro to Jupyter

# What is Jupyter?

- For this workshop, we will be using R via [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html)

- R is the programming language that runs computations
- Jupyter is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding convenient features and tools

## Jupyter Notebooks

Notebooks are a great tool for exploration and for documenting your workflow.
Notebooks allow you to write:
- Code
- Plots
- Formatted text
- Latex text for equations

and much more in a single document!

---

You can think of Jupyter Notebooks as the dashboard of a car.

You don’t drive a car by interacting with the engine but rather by interacting with the car’s dashboard.

In the same way, rather than interacting with R directly, we will be using the Jupyter's interface.

Jupyter will allow us to:
- Run R code interactively
- Use other languages such as Python, Julia, or Matlab!

This is what a Jupyter Notebook looks like:

- Notebooks are great for exploration and for documenting your workflow
- There are many options for sharing notebooks in human readable format:
  - Share online with [nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
  - Github renders automatically any notebooks that you push.
  - You can convert to HTML, PDF, etc. with [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This is an example of a Code Cell

```r
# Print something
print("Hello world", quote = FALSE)
```

```out
Hello world
```

This is a markdown cell:
```
Hello~!
```
---

- Slides can have code, bullet points, tables and pretty much all other Markdown
  elements.
- This is another bullet point.
