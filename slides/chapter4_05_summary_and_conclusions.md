# Binder is ...

- Code sharing made easy

- You will never have to say again "but it ran in my computer"

- A Binder Repository contains at minimum two elements:
    - Code or content that you want people to be able to run. 
    - Configuration files for the environment.
    
- Binders Hubs allow you to deploy Juypter Notebooks and Rmd the easy way

If you want to launch some sample binders take a look at:

[RMd Binder]

[R Jupyter Binder]

[Python Jupyter Binder]

# Advantages of Binder

# Limitations of Binder

- Each instance is limited to 2 gb of RAM and will get destroyed after 10 minutes of inactivity. 
- Each instance can run for a maximum of 24 hours before it will get killed.
- You can get around these limitations by hosting your own binder hub but this will require compute + devops resources from your side.
