---

# Step 1

- Create a **public** GitHub repository.
- You can name your GitHub repository as you like.
- Initialize your repository with a README!
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

---

# Step 2

- Inside your Github repository folder:
    - Create a Jupyter notebook.
    - Open a new code cell and write:
    ```
    import folium

    m = folium.Map(location=[49.267665596, -123.241999032], zoom_start=12)

    tooltip = "Click Here For More Info"

    marker = folium.Marker(
        location=[49.267665596, -123.241999032],
        popup="<stong>UBC</stong>",
        tooltip=tooltip)
    marker.add_to(m)

    m
    ```
    - Save the Jupyter notebook. 

---

# Step 3 

â€” Create an `environment.yml` file into your Github repository.

For our previous example, our dependencies are `folium` (and `pandas`).

Our `environment.yml` file should look like this:

```
name: my-example-environment
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - pandas
  - folium
```

You can find a template in the next "activity"

---

# Step 4 

- Push all your repository changes back to GitHub.
- Your repository should look now like this:

---

# Step 5

- Go to my binder.
- Type the URL of your repo into the "GitHub repo or URL" box. It should look like this:
```
https://github.com/your-username/my-first-python-binder
```

- Where it says Git ref type in main or the branch that you woud like to use.
- Where it says "URL to open (optional)" type in the notebook file name and choose "file". 

- As you type, the webpage generates a link in the "Copy the URL below..." box. It should look like this:
```
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/your-username/my-first-python-binder/HEAD
```

# Step 5b

- Once this is done simply hit the launch button. 
- My Binder will create your binder repo in a few minutes.
- Be patient. The first time it might take some while to build.

---

# Step 6

- Copy the generated link, open a new browser tab and visit that URL.

- You will see a "spinner" as Binder launches the repository.

---

# Step 7

- Navigate your Jupyter notebook.

---

# Step 8

- Once built, you can share the link to this with anybody you want to run your project on their machine.

- Save your LaunchBinder Badge and share it!
