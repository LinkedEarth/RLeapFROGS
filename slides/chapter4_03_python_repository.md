# Setting Up the Binder

---

# Step 1

- Create a **public** GitHub repository.
- You can name your GitHub repository as you like.
- Initialize your repository with a README!
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

---

# Step 2

- Inside your Github repository folder:
    - Create a Jupyter notebook.
    - Open a new code cell and write:
    ```
    print("Hello world!)
    ```
    - Save the Jupyter notebook. It should look like this:

---

# Step 3 

â€” Create an `environment.yml` file into your Github repository.
You can find a template in the next "activity"

---

# Step 4 

- Push all your repository changes back to GitHub.
- Your repository should look now like this:

---

# Step 5

- Go to my binder.
- Type the URL of your repo into the "GitHub repo or URL" box. It should look like this:
```
https://github.com/your-username/my-first-python-binder
```

- Where it says Git ref type in main or the branch that you woud like to use.
- Where it says path to notebook type in the notebook file name. 

- As you type, the webpage generates a link in the "Copy the URL below..." box. It should look like this:
```
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/your-username/my-first-python-binder/HEAD
```

- Once this is done simply hit the launch button. My Binder will create your binder repo in a few minutes.

---

# Step 6

- Copy the generated link, open a new browser tab and visit that URL.

- You will see a "spinner" as Binder launches the repository.

- Navigate your Jupyter notebook.

---

# Step 7

- Once built, you can share the link to this with anybody you want to run your project on their machine.

- Save your LaunchBinder Badge and share it!
