---

GitHub provides robust project management tools to help organize, track, and complete tasks in your projects. Hereâ€™s how to use features like Projects, Milestones, and Issues to streamline your workflow.

---

## Using GitHub Projects

Projects act as [Kanban boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) where you can organize tasks into customizable columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

You can see an example of a Project board for the Pyleoclim software [here](https://github.com/orgs/LinkedEarth/projects/7/views/1). The following slides give an overview on how to use GitHub projects for your project management. A more complete guide is available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects).

## Why Use GitHub for Project Management?

* Centralizes tasks and project details in one place.
* Encourages collaboration with team members.
* Tracks progress and maintains transparency.
* Integrates seamlessly with version control and repositories.

---

### How to Create a GitHub Project

1. Navigate to your repository.
2. Click the Projects tab.
3. Click New Project and choose either Table or Board (Kanban-style).
4. Name your project and add a description (optional).
5. Add columns:
    * Common column titles: "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed." Although not completely necessary, the completed column allows you to keep track of all the issues you have worked on in your project. When you are about to create a release, it is always a good feeling to see how much you have actually accomplished. 
6. Add tasks:
    * Click + Add a card in a column.
    * Link it to an Issue or create a standalone card.

---

### Using Projects

* Move cards between columns as tasks progress.
* Add labels or assignees to tasks for clarity.
* Track progress with built-in insights and views.

## Tracking Progress with Milestones

[Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) in GitHub are a way to group related tasks (issues and pull requests) under a single goal or deadline. They help track progress toward completing a larger project, such as finishing a research paper, finalizing a dataset, or releasing software. Each milestone includes a title, description, and optional due date, and displays the percentage of tasks completed, making it easy to monitor progress and stay organized.

---

### How to create a Milestone

1. Go to the Issues tab in your repository.
2. Click Milestones > New Milestone.
3. Fill in:
    * Title: e.g., "Submit Paper Draft"
    * Description: Outline the goal.
    * Due Date: Optional, but helps with deadlines. Due dates are also 
4. Click Create Milestone.

---

### Assign issues to Milestones

1. Open an issue.
2. In the right-hand sidebar, select the Milestone dropdown.
3. Choose a milestone to link the issue. Check our [intro to GitHub](https://linked.earth/LeapFROGS/module5) slides on how to create and write a good issue. 

---

## Combining Issues, Milestones, and Projects

* Assign issues to milestones for tracking progress toward a larger goal.
* Add issues to your project board for task management.
* Use filters in the Issues tab to see:
* Tasks related to a specific milestone.
* Tasks assigned to a specific user or label.

---

## Monitoring Progress

* View milestone progress on the Milestones page (e.g., percentage of issues completed).
* Use GitHub Insights (in repository settings) to see contributor activity and progress.
* Regularly update your Project Board to reflect task statuses.

---

## Collaborating with teams

* Use the Assignees field in issues or pull requests to assign tasks to team members.
* Use the Comments section to discuss tasks and share updates.
* Mention team members with @username to notify them.
