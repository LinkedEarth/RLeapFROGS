## What is GitHub?


[What is GitHub?](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/what-is-github.html)

[What is a GitHub Repository?](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-repos.html)

[Issues & Discussions](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/github/github-issues.html). Remember, when opening issues, always submit a minimum reproducible example. It doesn't have to use your own data, just something similar that you can simulate using a random generator or write manually. [Here](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/issues/469) is a great example of an issue with a minimum reproducible example.
